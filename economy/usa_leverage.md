In fiscal 2021, the average interest rate on federal debt was 1.6%

Inflation in the same peried was approximately 6%


If the inflation rate is 6% and the interest rate on government bonds is 1.6%, it means that the real (inflation-adjusted) value of the debt is decreasing over time. Here's why:

Inflation erodes the purchasing power of money: A 6% inflation rate means that, on average, prices are rising by 6% each year. This means that a dollar today will have less purchasing power in the future because you can buy fewer goods and services with it.

The interest rate on government bonds is lower than inflation: If the government is paying 1.6% interest on its bonds, but the inflation rate is 6%, it effectively means that the government is paying less in real (inflation-adjusted) terms than it is borrowing. This is because the interest rate on the bonds is not keeping up with the increase in prices caused by inflation.

USA National debt in 2021 was 28.5 trillion USD.

Here is the calculation of real value of the debt (100+1.6) / (100 + 6) = 95.8%
So the total value of the debt has reduced by 4.2% even with the interest rate in mind. 
4.2% approximate to 1.1 trillion dollar. This amount has burdened USD keepers in the form of inflation.
