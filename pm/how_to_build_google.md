Could you make Google? 
From a developers perspective it is really funny to hear a question like could you build an app like <some app name>? If yes, how much would it cost? from someone who would then force you to make calculations. The thing is - the whole question is incorrect. Let me try to explain, why the questions like this should never be asked and what would be a much better approach.

If you are a developer, chances are, that you have been in this situation millions of times. Someone recalls some app/website and asks you how much would it cost to make something similar? This something similar is killing me every time I hear it. If you are someone who has asked that - please don't do that. It is actually a useless question, and there is a huge chance, that the answer won't bring you any value, especially considering that most developers are not proactive and that good in explaining their reasoning to non-developers.
The question
Let me first explain to you, how the developers percept such a question. A similar situation might be when someone brings an image and asks how much would such a thing cost? Here is a nice example of an image. 
So what can we see here? We see a very nice looking and expensive sports car. But that actually does not tell us what the person, who brought the image wants. 

Here are a few guesses: 
* He wants a sports car 
* He wants a car (any car) 
* He wants a transport that can get him from point A to point B faster than going by foot. 
* He wants an image of a car. 
* He wants a model of a sports car. 

Any of these guesses a very much viable and one of the tricky nuances is that the cost of implementing of those options vary drastically, so a thorough discussion is absolutely necessary.
